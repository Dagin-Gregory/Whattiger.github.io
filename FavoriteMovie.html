	</head></h1>
	
		<p><h3>
		The plot is very interesting and every episode, they bring something different, or they might 
		elaborate or continue something that went on in the last episode, which too me is my favorite 
		part about the series

				My favorite actor in the X-Files, is David Duchovny because his acting was very good and he obviously cared alot about the series as he did it for nine seasons from 
				1992-2002, and when they decided too reboot the series, he and scully decided to make a return to the series in 2016.
